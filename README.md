##**Landon's Restaurant Menu App**##

##**How to Run Code**##

1. Run `python project.py` in the appropriate path.

2. Within the same path, you have the option of populating the database by
running `python lotsofmenus.py`.
3. Finally, go to your web browser and input: `http://localhost:5000`.

* I use Vagrant, so in your case you want to specify the path you stored this
project in on the command line. Then run `vagrant up` followed by
`vagrant ssh`, if you use Vagrant and it is set up in the location of the
project on your computer.
